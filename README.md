# LDA-Pre-Processing

Topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) can be a powerful tool in identifying semantic groups in vast unstructured textual data like discharge notes. However, prior to modeling, text must be prepared, and often this step involves extensive pre-processing. 

In this case, advanced pre-processing was applied to 1,000 discharge notes from the MIMIC-III data set. The final result can be used for
-Downstream modeling such as topic modeling with LDA. 
-Supervised and unsupervised text classification. 
-Similarity models such as TF â€“ IDF.
