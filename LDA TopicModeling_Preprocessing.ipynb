Notably, had a normal EKG and \\ndenied weakness, palpitations, lightheadedness. On ___, the \\npatient had a K of 5.6, again felt likely to be secondary to \\npseudohyperkalemia.  The patient has been counseled regarding \\nthis finding and of clinical signs for which she should seek \\nmedical attention. Will suggest re-check at outpatient provider \\nwith close ___.\\n\\n# Mild elevated transaminasemia: \\nElevated ALT to 52 and AST to 41 on ___  screening labs. Mild \\nelevation felt potentially secondary to initiation of \\nvalacyclovir for VZV reactivation. Downtrending on AM labs \\ntoday.  Will request recheck on close ___. \\n\\n# IUD malposition: \\nDuring CT AP w contrast, the patient was found to have \\nincidental finding of malpositioned IUD with myometrial \\ninvasion.

Now diuretic refractory given last tap was three days \\nago with 3L removed and she has already built up moderate \\nascites. Infectious workup negative, with CXR clear, UA \\ncontaminated but not grossly positive so will f/u culture, \\ndiagnostic para with only 225 WBC, RUQ US with no PV thrombus. \\nCompliant with diuretics but not following low sodium diet or \\nfluid restriction. Dr. ___ discussed possible TIPS in \\nthe office but due to lung disease, that was on hold pending \\nfurther cardiac evaluation. Diuretics were recently decreased \\ndue to hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. Held spironolactone for \\nnow due to K 5.2 and increased lasix 20 -> 40. No evidence of \\nsevere hyponatremia (Na<120) or renal failure Cr>2.0 to stop \\ndiuretics at present. Diagnostic paracentesis negative for \\ninfection. Ascitic total protein 0.3 so warrants SBP prophylaxis \\n(<1.0) and fortunately already on Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis \\nwhich would be appropriate for SBP ppx also. Patient did admit \\nto eating pizza and some ___ food prior to \\nadmission. She had therapeutic paracentesis with 4.3L removed \\nand received 37.5G albumin IV post procedure.

Infectious workup negative thus \\nfar. Continue lactulose 30mL TID and titrate to 3 BMs daily and \\ncontinue rifaximin 550mg BID. \\n \\n# HYPONATREMIA. Na 125 on admission, 128 four days ago, and 135 \\none month ago. Likely due to third spacing from worsening \\nascites and fluid overload. 1.5L fluid restriction, low salt \\ndiet. S/p therapeutic paracentesis with albumin replacement.\\n\\n# CIRRHOSIS, HEPATITIS C. MELD score of 10 and Child's ___ \\nclass B on this admission. Now decompensated due to ascites. \\nHepatitis C genotype IIIB. Dr. ___ starting \\n___ and ___ with patient in clinic and the \\ninsurance process was started by her office. No history of EGD, \\nneeds this as outpatient for varices screening.  \\n \\n# NUTRITION. Unclear if truly compliant with low salt diet. Poor \\noral intake. Low albumin 2.8 on admission. Met with nutrition. \\n \\n# COAGULOPATHY. INR 1.4 four days ago. No evidence of active \\nbleeding. Very mild thrombocytopenia with plts 143.  \\n \\n# HIV. Most recent CD4 173. On HAART.

        "1. Cleaning text of extraneous characters (already done above).\n",
        "2. Tokenization.\n",
        "  Tokenization of medical texts requires special attention due to unique and complex characteristics of medical content, among which we find: special structures like abbreviations; compound terms like \"chronic kidney disease which must remain fused / used as single tokens; negation found in false fused expressions such as \"patient denies\" or \"no chest pain\" which must not be fragmented.\n",
        "  In light of these challenges, the recommended approach is to use the pre-trained small clinical model from spaCy. However, upon several tests, a modified spaCy tokenizer is the final recommended approach. As a special rule, we will ensure that 1) numerical values and % sign are not seperated; 2) negative contractions like \"don't\" and \"can't\" are not separated; mutli-character separated by / are preserved.\n",
        "3. For clinical text: expansion of clinical abbreviations.\n",
        "  As there are numerous abbreviations in clinical text, the next step, lowercasing, may jeopardize meaningful topic extraction. Thus, we will extend clinical abbreviations based on what's presented in the notes; a more advanced approach is applying tools like QuickUMLS, MetaMap, or clinical BERT models. However, pre-trained models may over-normalize the text which will impact the quality of topic modeling, espcially if semantic accuracy is sufficient to approximate (not to reach 100% match).  "

This feels similar to prior episodes of ascites. Her diuretics were recently decreased on   due to worsening hyponatremia 128 and hyperkalemia 5.1. Patient states she has been compliant with her HIV and diuretic medications but never filled out the lactulose prescription. She states she has had   BMs daily at home.

In the past week, she notes that she has been having worsening abd distension and discomfort. She denies   edema, or SOB, or orthopnea. She denies f/c/n/v, d/c, dysuria. She had food poisoning a week ago from eating stale cake (n/v 20 min after food ingestion), which resolved the same day. She denies other recent illness or sick contacts. She notes that she has been noticing gum bleeding while brushing her teeth in recent weeks. she denies easy bruising, melena, BRBPR, hemetesis, hemoptysis, or hematuria. Because of her abd pain, she went to OSH ED and was transferred to   for further care. Per ED report, pt has brief period of confusion - she did not recall the ultrasound or bloodwork at osh. She denies recent drug use or alcohol use. She denies feeling confused, but reports that she is forgetful at times.

She was admitted to   for the same symptoms recently and had 3L fluid removed (no SBP) three days ago and felt better. Since discharge, her abdomen has become increasingly distended with pain. This feels similar to prior episodes of ascites. Her diuretics were recently decreased on   due to worsening hyponatremia 128 and hyperkalemia 5.1. Patient states she has been compliant with her HIV and diuretic medications but never filled out the lactulose prescription. She states she has had   BMs daily at home. She has had some visual hallucinations and forgetfulness. Her appetite has been poor. In the ED, initial vitals were 98.9 88 116/88 18 97% RA. CBC near baseline, INR 1.4, Na 125, Cr 0.6.

Pt reports self-discontinuing lasix and spirnolactone   weeks ago, because she feels like \"they don't do anything\" and that she \"doesn't want to put more chemicals in her.\" She does not follow Na-restricted diets. In the past week, she notes that she has been having worsening abd distension and discomfort. She denies   edema, or SOB, or orthopnea. She denies f/c/n/v, d/c, dysuria. She had food poisoning a week ago from eating stale cake (n/v 20 min after food ingestion), which resolved the same day. She denies other recent illness or sick contacts. She notes that she has been noticing gum bleeding while brushing her teeth in recent weeks. she denies easy bruising, melena, BRBPR, hemetesis, hemoptysis, or hematuria. Because of her abd pain, she went to OSH ED and was transferred to   for further care. Per ED report, pt has brief period of confusion - she did not recall the ultrasound or bloodwork at osh. She denies recent drug use or alcohol use. She denies feeling confused, but reports that she is forgetful at times.

              "1  with HIV on HAART, COPD, HCV cirrhosis complicated by ascites and HE admitted with abdominal distention and pain. She was admitted to   for the same symptoms recently and had 3L fluid removed (no SBP) three days ago and felt better. Since discharge, her abdomen has become increasingly distended with pain. This feels similar to prior episodes of ascites. Her diuretics were recently decreased on   due to worsening hyponatremia 128 and hyperkalemia 5.1. Patient states she has been compliant with her HIV and diuretic medications but never filled out the lactulose prescription. She states she has had   BMs daily at home. She has had some visual hallucinations and forgetfulness. Her appetite has been poor. In the ED, initial vitals were 98.9 88 116/88 18 97% RA. CBC near baseline, INR 1.4, Na 125, Cr 0.6. AST and ALT mildly above baseline 182 and 126 and albumin 2.8. Diagnostic para with 225 WBC, 7% PMN, total protein 0.3. UA with few bact, 6 WBC, mod leuk, neg nitr, but contaminated with 6 epi. CXR clear. RUQ US with no PV thrombus, moderate ascites. She was given ondansetron 4mg IV and morphine 2.5mg IV x1 in the ED. On the floor, she is feeling improved but still has abdominal distention and discomfort. ROS:  Abdominal distention and pain. No black/bloody stools. No   pain or swelling. No fevers or chills.
